I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Computer Science Director of Research at [City St George's, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/ernesto-jimenez-ruiz) affiliated to the [Adaptive Computer Systems and Machine Learning](https://www.city.ac.uk/research/centres/acsml) group. 
I am also one of the chairs of the Alan Turing Institute Interest Group on [Knowledge Graphs](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/knowledge-graphs).

I previously held a Senior Research Associate position at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/ernesto-jimenez-ruiz) in London (UK), a Research Assistant position at the [University of Oxford](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ernesto.jimenez-ruiz/), a part-time research position in the [Centre for Scalable Data Access (SIRIUS)](https://sirius-labs.no/ernesto-jimenez-ruiz-researcher/) at the University of Oslo, Norway; and a PhD fellowship at the ([Universitat Jaume I, Castellon, Spain](https://www.uji.es/)) working in the [Temporal Knowledge Bases Group](https://krono.act.uji.es/). My home university awarded a “Premio extraordinario de doctorado” (roughly translated as a [Extraordinary Doctoral Award](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/514-full.html)) to the research outcomes of my doctoral thesis (Engineering category 2010-2011).

My research, over the past 20 years, has covered several areas within AI. Currently, I focus on the intersection between Knowledge Representation (e.g., Knowledge Graphs) and Machine Learning with a special interest in creating more reliable and robust AI solutions. Knowledge graphs play a key role in AI and Data Science to enhance data-driven techniques with, among others, context and explainability.
