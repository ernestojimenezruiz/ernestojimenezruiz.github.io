I am leading the **Semantic Web Technologies and Knowledge Graphs (SWT&KG)** module delivered to both UG and PG students at City St George's, University of London.

The module trains the new generation of data and computer scientists with the necessary skills in semantic technologies and knowledge representation to meet todayâ€™s demands from industry; where data scientists are expected to semantically orchestrate diverse types of data sources, and use both data-and-knowledge-driven AI techniques.
